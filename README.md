This applications purpose is to give accurate readings of the weather which the user inputs themselves, using openweathermap API. Once they enter their location of choice, they are greated with 2 groups of information, the current forecast and a 5 day forecast.
This assignment was meant to test my ability using API's, namely bootstrap and openweathermap API. And get me to practice all the skills i have already learned during the course.
